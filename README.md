## Project Objective:
The objective of the project is to create a machine learning model. We are doing a supervised learning and our aim is to do estimate the flight fare.

## Data Collection:
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle. 
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh/

## Modelling:
The analysis and model creation can be found in the .ipynb file. 

The main packages used are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.  

## Deployemnt:
The web app has been build using basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flask and Herkou.

Due to big size of pickle file, the app has not been delpoyed on a server, but it can be used on a local server.

## Requirements Installation:
The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Future Scope:
* Use multiple Algorithms
* Optimize Flask app.py
* Update the Front-End
